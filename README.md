# My Python Functions

This is a place where I maintain some useful python funtions.  
This repository can be installed as a module via: **pip install git+https://github.com/HennersMcGee/my_py_fns.git**.  
The reason for this is that some functions are used in more that one project or repository.  
Rather than having to maintain them in all the separate places, it made sense to package them up.
